// As you may know, an anagram is a new word created by reorganizing all the letters in a word.
// This array of anagrams are all based on the word "Stop"
let anagrams = ["plots", "post", "stop", "puts", "tops"]

// Run this program after you try each step and see if it worked.
// At the very bottom of this file is a line of code that prints out the array after your code is run.
// You're welcome to print additional debugging statements if you need.

// 1. Print out the third word in the array using bracket notation.





// 2. The word "opts" is also an anagram of the word "stop". Find a way to add "opts" to the end of the array.





// 3. The word "puts", on the other hand, is not an anagram of the word "stop". Find a way to replace it with the word "pots".





// 4. Use the documentation to figure out what the method ".shift()" does.
//   Now use it to remove the word "plots" (which isn't a correct anagram of "stop") from our array.





// 5. Put the final array of anagrams in alphabetical order.




// This code prints the array after you've manipulated it above.
console.log(anagrams)

// LEVEL 2: At this point, the tasks will get more challenging, because you'll work with datasets too large to handle by just looking at it and reading it.
// The arrays used in the second half of this lab will be stored in a neighboring file called "otherArrays.js".
// If you'd like to look at that file, you certainly may, but do your work here.

// Pro-tip: to make this easier, comment out the line "console.log(anagrams)" above so that you aren't printing extra information.
//
//     The first array is called "fortunes" and contains fortune-cookie style fortunes.
//
//  6. Print out the 10th fourtune from the array.



//  7. Print out fortunes 12, 13, and 14 from the array. There are several ways to do this, and any way is totally fine.



// 8. This array is huge, so it'd be helpful to know how many fortunes are listed. Find a way to print out the number of fortunes in the array.



// 9. Print out a random fortune from the array.








// 10. Bonus challenge: Out of all the fotunes that are there, it'd mess up the program if some were listed twice, but with an array that big, it could happen.
// Find a way to check and see whether any of the fortunes are duplicates - make a separate array of those fortunes.
// Once you have the array of duplicated fortunes, find a way to delete those duplicates.
